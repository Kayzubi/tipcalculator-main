# tipcalculator-main
A frontend Mentor task for a tip calculator, built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vanilla JS.

While building this Web Application I was able to practice DOM manipulatiom without Jquery, For loops, Function declarations, Iterations using If Else and Swicth statements.
This is also my first application applying CSS grids.
